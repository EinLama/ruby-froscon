abstract: |
  During the session the sample B2B SaaS application maschinendirigent.de will be presented and the main challenges will be discussed.
  Maschinendirigent.de is a software for farmers and the funny thing is, that both founders donâ€™t have any agriculture background. They argue, that the abilitiy of building good and working software is much more worth then being an expert in a specific field.
  Therefore Ruby on Rails was the perfect choice.
