abstract: |
  Fancy is a new dynamic, pure object-oriented programming language that runs on Rubinius, the Ruby VM. It compiles to
  Rubinius bytecode & provides first-class integration with Ruby and any Ruby C-extensions that work on Rubinius.  Fancy
  is inspired by Smalltalk, Ruby & Io, has a simple & consistent syntax, is easy to learn & self-hosted. Its
  keyword-message syntax allows creating custom domain specific languages & control structures easily. We'll cover several
  examples and explain their implementation.
